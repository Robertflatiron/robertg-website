<h1>Welcome To My Build!</h1>
<script src="script.js"></script>
<p>Hello all, my name is Robert G and here I will discuss a few events which<br> took place while owning my motorcycle. I will also go over some <br> of the modifications I have made to compare to stock.<br> I hope you all enjoy!<br> </p>
<h2>Stock (no modifications)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The exhaust system was OEM (from the factory)</li>
        <li>The motorcycle was <strong>not</strong> "lowered" for better aerodynamics</li>
        <li>Motorcycle has the OEM air filter</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Modified</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I purchased an exhaust system</li>
        <li>I purchased a Sprint Air Filter</li>
        <li>I purchased a QuickShifter</li>
        <li>I "lowered" the motorcycle for better aerodynamics</li>
        <li>I have flashed and tuned the ECU</li>
    </ul>
<p2>Upon completion of these modifications, my motorcycle was stolen from me. But with the assistance of the GPS which was installed on the motorcycle, I was able to retrieve it. <br> I assisted the Dallas Police Department in the retrieval of my motorcycle, along with the physical arrest of the criminal. <br> As a foot chase commence, the DPD officer gave me the verbal comand to "get him". He did this because he was not fast enough to catch the criminal.</p2>
<h1>Thank you all for visiting my page and I hope you were able to get a little feeling into what I went through to. </h1>
